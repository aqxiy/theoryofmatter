3 and 1 counter variable 

1 counter variable

### Corollary:

2 ways you either are or are not

3 ways of being (epn)

4 ways you can be (quantum states)



So binary

Electron, proton, neutron fundamental principle

4 ways of ascribing function oneness 

{
ONE to ONE

ONE to MANY

MANY to ONE

MANY TO MANY
}


### Tack-On

BTW, avoid bluetooth buds because the waves are bad for the brain

"It has been found that RF-EMF can induce changes in central nervous system nerve cells, including neuronal cell apoptosis, changes in the function of the nerve myelin and ion channels; furthermore, RF-EMF act as a stress source in living creatures."

OK so there's less RNG when transmitter is close

the waves have less time / space to become normed with environment

so there's outsize impact

idk just my overall view is this has relevance and justifies
